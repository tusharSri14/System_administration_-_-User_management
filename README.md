#System Administration & User Management
Overview

Managing users and groups is a routine task for every Linux administrator. Doing this manually is time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this, I created a Bash script that automates these operations, enforces security policies, and provides better visibility into user activity.

Features

Create, delete, and manage users and groups with a single script.

Automatically assign default shell and home directory.

Enforce password expiry policies for better security.

Track failed login attempts for auditing and troubleshooting.
